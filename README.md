# UF4RS
**UNC Filesystem for Roblox Studio**

## Overview
A simple pseudo-temporary filesystem implementation designed for Roblox Studio. It based on Roblox Exploit's UNC (Universal Naming Convention) filesystem functions, commonly used in Roblox exploit environments.

## How It Works
This system uses Robloxâ€™s `Folder` instances to create pseudo folders and a root filesystem (`rootfs`). `StringValue` instances are used to represent individual files, storing both file names and content.

## Purpose
Originally aimed at facilitating quicker project/script development in Roblox exploit environments, this can also be adapted for general filesystem functionality in Roblox Studio.

## Usage
To use UF4RS:
1. Copy the source code and put it into your project.
2. Also you can implement this pseudo-filesystem into a `ModuleScript`.
3. You can configure the `rootfs` path and name as needed, this is optional.

## Example
IYKYK
No example for you here, just look for filesystem doccumentation on various executors [here](https://github.com/luau/Executor-API-Docs)

You want to skid it? sure lmao, make sure to credit me or whatever.
